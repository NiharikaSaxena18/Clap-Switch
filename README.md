# Clap-Switch
- This was developed as a part of the course project for the subject "Fundamentals of Electrical and Electronics" during Semester-1.
## Introduction
CLAP SWITCH is a switch which can switch on/off any electrical circuit by the sound of the clap. The basic idea of clap switch is that the electric microphone picks up the sound of your claps, coughs and the sound of books knocked off the table. It produces a small electrical signal. This circuit is used to make the light ON through a clap sound but it can work through any kind of same pitch sound. This circuit turns ‘ON’ light for the first clap. For the next clap, the light turns OFF. This circuit works with 9V voltage.
## Circuit Elements
1. Resistors like 1k, 47k, 4.7k, 470 ohms & 330 ohms
2. Battery – 9V
3. Capacitors – 100nF and 100uF
4. IC555 Timer
5. Microphone
6. LED
7. BC547 transistors – 2

## Advantages
1. The primary application involves an elderly or mobility-impaired person. 
2. We can turn something (e.g. a lamp) on and off from any location in the room (e.g. while lying in the bed) simply by clapping our hands. 
3. Low cost and reliable circuit. 
4. Complete elimination of man power. 
5. Energy efficient.
## Conclusion
The clap activated switching device functions properly by responding to claps at about three to four meter away and finger tap sounds at very close range, since both are low frequency sounds and produce the same-pulse wave features. The resulting device has a good reliability and is relatively cheap. This circuit is very useful in field of electronic circuits. By using some modification, its area of application can be extended in various fields.
